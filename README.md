# ML Classification Pipeline Project

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning (ML) pipeline developed for a classification problem using a provided training dataset and corresponding label file. The goal is to predict the labels based on the features in the dataset.

## Project Objectives
- Develop an ML pipeline to predict labels.
- Utilize a programming language of your choice.
- Document all steps taken throughout the process.
- Perform a 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance.

## Expectations
1. **Documentation**: Clearly document each step of your approach, including data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation.
2. **Cross-Validation**: Implement 10-fold cross-validation to ensure robust performance metrics.
3. **Success Criteria/Metrics**: Define and justify the metrics used for evaluating the model's performance.
4. **Future Improvements**: Suggest ideas for enhancing the classification pipeline in future iterations.

## Steps to Follow
1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Load and inspect the dataset.
   - Understand the distribution of features and labels.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values, if any.
   - Normalize or standardize features as needed.
   - Encode categorical variables.

3. **Model Selection**:
   - Choose appropriate classification algorithms based on the problem context.
   - Consider models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Support Vector Machines.

4. **Training and Evaluation**:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train the selected model(s) using the training set.
   - Evaluate model performance using 10-fold cross-validation.

5. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or ROC-AUC.
   - Justify your choice of metrics based on the problem requirements.

6. **Results Analysis**:
   - Present results from cross-validation and discuss findings.
   - Analyze any discrepancies or unexpected results.

7. **Future Work**:
   - Suggest potential improvements such as feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, or exploring advanced models like ensemble methods or neural networks.

## Timeline
- Aim to complete this assignment by this weekend.
- A follow-up discussion will be scheduled within 2-3 days post-submission to review findings and insights.

## Conclusion
This project aims to provide a comprehensive approach to building a classification pipeline while ensuring thorough documentation and evaluation of model performance. Your insights and suggestions for future improvements will be invaluable in refining this process.
